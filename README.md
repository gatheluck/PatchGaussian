# Patch Gaussian

This is an unofficial pytorch implementation of Patch Gaussian augmentation which is proposed in the paper, [Improving Robustness Without Sacrificing Accuracy with Patch Gaussian Augmentation [Lopes+, ArXiv 2019]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02611).

Patch Gaussian is a simple augmentation scheme that adds noise to randomly selected patches in an input image. This simple augmentation help to overcome the trade-off between robustness and accuracy.
